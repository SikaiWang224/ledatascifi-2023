Somehow, I am still a Lions fan, even though stints in AZ, CA, PA, NY, TX, and FL has given me many chances to abandon ship!   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I'm currenty a senior studying finance. Outside of classes, I love watching basketball (let's go Mavs!), listening to music, and trying to nail the perfect cold brew coffee recipe.

### Drop-in Hours are on [coursesite](https://coursesite.lehigh.edu/course/view.php?id=236371)

Aka "Office Hours". 

```{note}  
**I suspect that the initial learning curve will be steep, so we have posted a lot of office hours. Around Valentines Day, we will reduce our explicit office hours. Remember, when you get stuck, _especially_ on installation and set up issues,**
- look at the [help](help) page
- post a question in our [classmates team](https://github.com/orgs/LeDataSciFi/teams/classmates-2022)
- check out the [resources](resources) page and the [tips](tips) page

**Office hour schedules are subject to change, so please check back!**
