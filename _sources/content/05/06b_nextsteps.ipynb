    "1. Use `plotly`/`dash` to build the dashboard so it works on your computer. Then, you need to \"deploy\" it so that it is a website people can visit and interact with. (There are several ways to deploy the app, but \"heroku\" is the most popular right now. [A written walkthrough](https://realpython.com/python-dash/#deploy-your-dash-application-to-heroku) to build [this page](https://avocado-analytics.herokuapp.com/). And a [good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv910_b5ID0) showing different approaches based on the data needs of your site.)\n",
