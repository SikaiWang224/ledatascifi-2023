    "Currently, I recommend one of these approaches to build a (free) website with an interactive component:\n",
    "1. Use `plotly`/`dash` to build the dashboard so it works on your computer. Then, you need to \"deploy\" it so that it is a website people can visit and interact with. The best free options **as of late 2022** are:\n",
    "    - [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), you just need to click \"renew\" every three months\n",
    "    - [Vercel](Vercel.com)\n",
    "    - My previous suggestion was Heroku, but it is not completely free anymore. (It offers [a free plan for students for 12 months.](https://blog.heroku.com/github-student-developer-program)) [A written walkthrough](https://realpython.com/python-dash/#deploy-your-dash-application-to-heroku) to build [this page](https://avocado-analytics.herokuapp.com/). And a [good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv910_b5ID0) showing different approaches based on the data needs of your site.\n",
    "1. [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) has very similar features to `plotly`/`dash` and makes building an app/dashboard easy ([examples here](https://streamlit.io/gallery)). Deploying the app to a website is easy as heck and free as long as traffic to the site is low.\n",
    "1. [Use `shiny` to build and serve the dashboard.](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/) The \"deploy\" part is easy with `shiny`, but because the package is still in development, things might change. \n",
    "1. Write a JupyterLab file that shows what you want shown on the website. You can go outside the `plotly` ecosystem and use `seaborn`, for example. The \"Mercury\" framework will create the webpage for you. You still need to deploy it somehow.
