    "This class is essentially an applied Python course, because mastering it opens a lot of possibilities (see [here](../01/01_Motivation), [here](hall_of_awesomeness), [here](objectives), and [here](outcomes)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To encourage access, this class was set up without a coding pre-req. **However, there is no avoiding the reality that programming is a skill you can only learn by doing. If you have not coded before, you will have a steeper curve at the beginning of the class.**\n",

    "You should know:\n",
    "1. Every year, [students with little or no coding background succeed in this class.](outcomes) \n",
    "1. **You will have tremendous support because we want to see you succeed!** \n",
    "    - The class is designed to be accessible (with focus on achievable on-ramps to applied problems, no CompSci theory)\n",
    "    - I invest in you: There is a TA, and we probably offer more office hours in the initial weeks of the semester than any class you have ever taken\n",
    "1. The [pre-class bootcamp below](#Pre-Class-Bootcamp-(New-in-2023!)) is meant to level the playing field. \n",
    "    - Very quickly you'll have code running, which is exciting! \n",
    "    - Any work you do before the semester will make the class easier. (High ROI.)\n",
    "    - Suggested time investment: 10-20 hours will put you in **great** shape for the class. \n",
    "        - Even just 5 hours will be helpful. \n",
    "        - More will set you on a path to the [Hall of Awesomeness](hall_of_awesomeness).\n"
